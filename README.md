## Description

The Coding Quiz challenged us to create our html, css and js from scratch, with our only guidelines being the Acceptance Criteria and an example of how the final result should look/function. The result is a dynamic page with and intro, timer, questions/answers, and high scores.

The quiz begins with a start page explaining how the quiz works. Users are made aware they only have 75 seconds to take the quiz and that for every question missed, 10 seconds will be taken from their time.

Once the user begins, the timer begins to countdown in the upper right corner of the header. Users are asked 5 questions about coding. Once answered, users will be notified if they got the question right or wrong in the footer.

When finished, users will be given their final score and asked to provide their initials to submit to the high score page. From there the user is taken to the high score page where they may see how they faired against other quiz takers.

If desired, users may click the Take Quiz button and be redirected to be first question of the quiz. From here students may take the quiz again.

There is also a High Scores button in the left corner of the header. If at any point a user wants to leave to quiz to see high scores, they may click here.
